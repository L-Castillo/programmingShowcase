    <h2>Python Module Experiment</h2>
    <p> This experiment aimed to measure how participants intervene in a causal structure to learn its properties. This is indeed a real experiment ran by Bramley et al. (2015), which I replicated to showcase my programming skills for my Computer Programming module.

        Clicking the button below will download the files to run the experiment. A compiled executable.exe is included so that no packages need to be installed to see it (but .py files also included so code is available)
